# Answering-The-Questions-from-dvdrental-Database-using-SQL
when we first learn about relational databases using SQL, we will use the dvdrental database as an example database. This time I will answer a few questions to be able to explore more in the dvdrental database using SQL queries. The questions given by mentor at IYKRA.

The Questions are:

A customer wants to know the films about "astronout". How many recommendations could you give for him?

I wonder, how many films have a rating of "R" and a replacement cost between $5 and $15?

We have two staff members with staff IDs 1 and 2. We want to give a bonus to the staff member that handled the most payments. How many payments did each staff member handle? And how much was the total amount processed by each staff member?

Corporate headquarters is auditing the store, they want to know the average replacement cost of movies by rating

We want to send coupons to the 5 customers who have spent the most amount of money. Get the customer name, email, and either spent amount!

We want to audit our stock of films in all of our stores. How many copies of each movie in each store do we have?

We want to know what customers are eligible for our platinum credit card. The requirements are that the customer has at least a total of 40 transaction payments. Get the customer name, email who are eligible for the credit card!
